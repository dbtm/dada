Project for analysis of trial-based neurophysiological and behavioral data. 

The project consists of:
1. a standardized data structure format containing data for each trial and metadata for recording conditions,
2. a standardized path structure for storing code, raw data, processed data, analysis results, etc, and
2. a core set of utility functions for operating on said data structure.

Currently implemented in matlab.
